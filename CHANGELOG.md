## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Homebrew tap.** `brew install CVERInc/clikae/clikae` now works, served from
  the [`CVERInc/homebrew-clikae`](https://github.com/CVERInc/homebrew-clikae)
  tap (formula tracks v0.2.0).
- **`clikae migrate --keep-login`.** On macOS, Claude Code stores its OAuth token
  in the login Keychain keyed by the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` path, so migrating
  (which moves the dir to a new path) otherwise forces a one-time re-login per
  profile. `--keep-login` carries the saved token from the old path's keychain
  entry to the new one as part of the move. Implemented as an optional adapter
  hook (`adapter_migrate_credentials`) so the keychain logic stays in
  `lib/adapters/claude.sh`; off by default, and the token never leaves the
  Keychain.

### Changed

- Documented that migrating a claude setup on macOS asks you to log in again
  unless you pass `--keep-login` — with the why (keychain token keyed by the
  config-dir path) and both recovery paths — in `docs/usage.md` and
  `docs/troubleshooting.md`.
- New `docs/claude-on-macos.md` recording two macOS-specific Claude Code
  behaviours found while dogfooding: the Keychain-stored login token (keyed by
  the config-dir path) and the "Welcome back" box vs compact logo (driven by
  `.claude.json` counters + `CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_FULL_LOGO`, never the path).
  Confirmed against the Claude Code 2.1.156 binary. Linked from the README and
  troubleshooting.

- Docs split: README trimmed to "what + why" plus a 30-second demo and links;
  install, full usage/command reference, the `migrate` guide, and how-it-works
  moved into `docs/installation.md` and `docs/usage.md`; new
  `docs/troubleshooting.md`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- Built-in adapters for **GitHub CLI** (`gh`), **Google Cloud** (`gcloud`),
  **Docker** (`docker`), **Helm** (`helm`), **kubectl** (`kubectl`, the first
  `env-file` adapter), and **AWS** (`aws`, the first `env-var` adapter).
- `clikae migrate [<cli>]` — adopt a hand-rolled "config dir + shell alias"
  setup (e.g. the `~/.claude-acct-{a,b}` dual-account pattern) into clikae: it
  moves each referenced config directory under `~/.clikae/profiles/<cli>/<p>/`
  and rewrites the alias into clikae's managed sentinel block. Previews the plan
  and confirms first, backs up the rc once, and never overwrites an existing
  profile. Supports `--dry-run` and `--force`.
- `bats-core` test suite under `tests/bats/` (init, alias, list, remove, app,
  migrate, adapters, and bash-3.2 compatibility guards). Each test runs in an
  isolated throwaway `$HOME` + `$CLIKAE_HOME`.

### Fixed

- `clikae app` produced an uncompilable AppleScript on macOS: the command was
  substituted into the template with `sed`, but BSD/macOS `sed` strips
  backslashes from the replacement string, so the escaped `\"` collapsed to `"`
  and terminated the AppleScript string early. Substitution now uses bash
  parameter expansion (and escapes backslashes before quotes), so launchers
  compile and run correctly. This path was never exercised in v0.1.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- Initial v0.1 scaffold: pure-bash CLI dispatcher (`bin/clikae`) with a small
  modular `lib/` (core, commands, adapters, templates).
- `clikae init <cli> <profile>` — create a profile under `~/.clikae/profiles/<cli>/<profile>`.
- `clikae alias <cli> <profile>` — write a managed alias block to the user's shell rc.
- `clikae app <cli> <profile>` — generate a macOS double-click launcher `.app`
  with a custom Terminal window title.
- `clikae run <cli> <profile> [-- args]` — run a CLI with a profile, no alias needed.
- `clikae list`, `clikae info`, `clikae adapters`, `clikae help`.
- `clikae remove <cli> <profile>` — atomically clean up the dir, alias block, and `.app`.
- Built-in adapter for **Anthropic Claude Code** (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`).
- Adapter template and developer guide for adding new CLIs.
- `install.sh` for `curl | bash` installs and a Homebrew formula template.
- MIT License.
