## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`clikae app --terminal <app>` — choose the terminal the launcher opens.**
  In addition to Terminal.app (default), the generated `.app` can open **iTerm2**
  (`--terminal iterm2`) or **Ghostty** (`--terminal ghostty`). Terminal.app and
  iTerm2 are driven via their AppleScript scripting APIs; Ghostty has no
  window-opening CLI on macOS, so its launcher goes through
  `open -na Ghostty.app --args --title=… -e /bin/zsh -lc '…'` (env vars and
  spaces in paths preserved). The default target can be set with the
  `$CLIKAE_TERMINAL` environment variable. The chosen terminal must be installed;
  `app` fails with a clear message otherwise. Covered by bats (Ghostty path
  asserted when installed; the not-found path otherwise).
- **`clikae relay <cli> [<from>] <to>` — hand a live session to another profile.**
  clikae's origin story is keeping a second account because one account's quota
  runs out mid-task; `relay` makes that switch seamless. For Claude Code it copies
  the current directory's most recent transcript from the source profile into the
  target profile and resumes it (`claude --resume <id>`), so the conversation
  continues but new turns burn the target profile's quota. The source profile is
  never modified (relay copies, never moves), and with no transcript to carry it
  just starts a fresh session. The source profile is auto-detected from this
  shell's env var when only the target is given. Implemented via a new optional
  adapter hook `adapter_relay <from_dir> <to_dir>` (Claude-only; other adapters
  fall back to a plain start under the target). Covered by bats.
- **`clikae status [<cli>]` — show which profile each CLI is on in this shell.**
  Reads the live value of each adapter's env var and resolves it back to a clikae
  profile. Reports `(default)` when the var is unset and `(external)` when it
  points outside the clikae profile store. Foundational for the planned menu-bar
  GUI. Covered by bats.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added

- **Four more built-in adapters (now 11 total).** `az` (Azure CLI, env-dir
  `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR`), `npm` (env-file `NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG` — a per-profile
  `.npmrc` holding registry auth tokens), `terraform` (env-file
  `TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` — Terraform Cloud / registry credentials) and `pulumi`
  (env-dir `PULUMI_HOME`). The two env-file adapters seed an empty config file
  on `init`. The Windows PowerShell adapter table is kept in sync.
- **Windows / PowerShell support (v0.4).** New `powershell/Clikae.psm1` module
  ports the tool to native Windows PowerShell — no bash required. It mirrors the
  built-in adapters and the profile-store layout, and since PowerShell aliases
  can't carry env vars it writes a sentinel-wrapped *function* (e.g.
  `claude-work`) into your `$PROFILE` instead of an alias. Verbs: `New-`/`Get-`/
  `Remove-`/`Invoke-ClikaeProfile`, `Add-ClikaeFunction`, `Get-ClikaeAdapter`,
  and a Windows-only `New-ClikaeShortcut` (`.lnk`). Backs up `$PROFILE` before
  editing and supports `-WhatIf`/`-Confirm`. Covered by a Pester suite
  (`powershell/Clikae.Tests.ps1`) run in CI on `windows-latest` under both
  PowerShell 7 and Windows PowerShell 5.1.
- **`clikae migrate` in-use guard.** `migrate` now refuses to move a config
  directory that the CLI is currently using in your shell — i.e. when the live
  `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (or whichever env var the adapter uses) points at a dir
  slated to move. Previously this was only documented as a sharp edge; running
  `migrate` from inside the very session whose config dir was being moved could
  pull the directory out from under the live process and leave split state. The
  guard is not bypassed by `--force` (it protects data, it isn't a confirmation)
  and never blocks `--dry-run`.

### Changed

- CI: bumped `actions/checkout` to v5 (the v4 pin runs on the now-deprecated
  Node 20 runtime) and added a `windows-latest` Pester job.

### Fixed

- CI: the bats step now runs with `-r`, so the `tests/bats/adapters/`
  subdirectory is actually executed. It was previously skipped — `bats` does not
  recurse into subdirectories without the flag — meaning the adapter-listing
  tests never ran in CI.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Homebrew tap.** `brew install CVERInc/clikae/clikae` now works, served from
  the [`CVERInc/homebrew-clikae`](https://github.com/CVERInc/homebrew-clikae)
  tap (formula tracks v0.3.0).
- **`clikae migrate --keep-login`.** On macOS, Claude Code stores its OAuth token
  in the login Keychain keyed by the `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` path, so migrating
  (which moves the dir to a new path) otherwise forces a one-time re-login per
  profile. `--keep-login` carries the saved token from the old path's keychain
  entry to the new one as part of the move. Implemented as an optional adapter
  hook (`adapter_migrate_credentials`) so the keychain logic stays in
  `lib/adapters/claude.sh`; off by default, and the token never leaves the
  Keychain.

### Changed

- Documented that migrating a claude setup on macOS asks you to log in again
  unless you pass `--keep-login` — with the why (keychain token keyed by the
  config-dir path) and both recovery paths — in `docs/usage.md` and
  `docs/troubleshooting.md`.
- New `docs/claude-on-macos.md` recording two macOS-specific Claude Code
  behaviours found while dogfooding: the Keychain-stored login token (keyed by
  the config-dir path) and the "Welcome back" box vs compact logo (driven by
  `.claude.json` counters + `CLAUDE_CODE_FORCE_FULL_LOGO`, never the path).
  Confirmed against the Claude Code 2.1.156 binary. Linked from the README and
  troubleshooting.

- Docs split: README trimmed to "what + why" plus a 30-second demo and links;
  install, full usage/command reference, the `migrate` guide, and how-it-works
  moved into `docs/installation.md` and `docs/usage.md`; new
  `docs/troubleshooting.md`.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- Built-in adapters for **GitHub CLI** (`gh`), **Google Cloud** (`gcloud`),
  **Docker** (`docker`), **Helm** (`helm`), **kubectl** (`kubectl`, the first
  `env-file` adapter), and **AWS** (`aws`, the first `env-var` adapter).
- `clikae migrate [<cli>]` — adopt a hand-rolled "config dir + shell alias"
  setup (e.g. the `~/.claude-acct-{a,b}` dual-account pattern) into clikae: it
  moves each referenced config directory under `~/.clikae/profiles/<cli>/<p>/`
  and rewrites the alias into clikae's managed sentinel block. Previews the plan
  and confirms first, backs up the rc once, and never overwrites an existing
  profile. Supports `--dry-run` and `--force`.
- `bats-core` test suite under `tests/bats/` (init, alias, list, remove, app,
  migrate, adapters, and bash-3.2 compatibility guards). Each test runs in an
  isolated throwaway `$HOME` + `$CLIKAE_HOME`.

### Fixed

- `clikae app` produced an uncompilable AppleScript on macOS: the command was
  substituted into the template with `sed`, but BSD/macOS `sed` strips
  backslashes from the replacement string, so the escaped `\"` collapsed to `"`
  and terminated the AppleScript string early. Substitution now uses bash
  parameter expansion (and escapes backslashes before quotes), so launchers
  compile and run correctly. This path was never exercised in v0.1.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-28

### Added

- Initial v0.1 scaffold: pure-bash CLI dispatcher (`bin/clikae`) with a small
  modular `lib/` (core, commands, adapters, templates).
- `clikae init <cli> <profile>` — create a profile under `~/.clikae/profiles/<cli>/<profile>`.
- `clikae alias <cli> <profile>` — write a managed alias block to the user's shell rc.
- `clikae app <cli> <profile>` — generate a macOS double-click launcher `.app`
  with a custom Terminal window title.
- `clikae run <cli> <profile> [-- args]` — run a CLI with a profile, no alias needed.
- `clikae list`, `clikae info`, `clikae adapters`, `clikae help`.
- `clikae remove <cli> <profile>` — atomically clean up the dir, alias block, and `.app`.
- Built-in adapter for **Anthropic Claude Code** (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`).
- Adapter template and developer guide for adding new CLIs.
- `install.sh` for `curl | bash` installs and a Homebrew formula template.
- MIT License.
